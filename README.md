ansible-mutillidae
=========

An Ansible role to install [Mutillidae II](https://github.com/webpwnized/mutillidae), a deliberately vulnerable web application, on an Ubuntu host. This may work on other Debian-based derivatives, but has not been tested.

Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables
passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: ansible-mutillidae, x: 42 }
